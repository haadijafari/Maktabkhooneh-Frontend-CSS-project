        <h2>What is Hack?</h2>

        A security hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching
        defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network.
        Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit,
        protest, information gathering, challenge, recreation, or evaluation
        of a system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against
        potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is
        often referred to as the "computer underground".
      </div>

      <div id="white-hat">
        <h2>White hat</h2>

        A white hat hacker breaks security for non-malicious reasons, either
        to test their own security system, perform penetration tests or
        vulnerability assessments for a client, or while working for a
        security company that makes security software. The term is generally
        synonymous with ethical hacker, and the EC-Council, among others, have
        developed certifications, courseware, classes, and online training
        covering the diverse arena of ethical hacking.
      </div>

      <div id="black-hat">
        <h2>Black hat</h2>

        A black hat hacker is a hacker who "violates computer security for
        little reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain" (Moore,
        2005). The term was coined by Richard Stallman, to contrast the
        maliciousness of a criminal hacker versus the spirit of playfulness
        and exploration in hacker culture, or the ethos of the white hat
        hacker who performs hacking duties to identify places to repair or as
        a means of legitimate employment. Black hat hackers form the
        stereotypical, illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular
        culture, and are "the epitome of all that the public fears in a
        computer criminal".
      </div>

      <div id="gray-hat">
        <h2>Grey hat</h2>

        A grey hat hacker lies between a black hat and a white hat hacker,
        hacking for ideological reasons. A grey hat hacker may surf the
        Internet and hack into a computer system for the sole purpose of
        notifying the administrator that their system has a security defect,
        for example. They may then offer to correct the defect for a fee. Grey
        hat hackers sometimes find the defect in a system and publish the
        facts to the world instead of a group of people. Even though grey hat
        hackers may not necessarily perform hacking for their personal gain,
        unauthorized access to a system can be considered illegal and
        unethical.
