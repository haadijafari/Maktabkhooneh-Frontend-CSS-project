          <h2>What is Hack?</h2>

          A security hacker is someone who explores methods for breaching
          defenses and exploiting weaknesses in a computer system or network.
          Hackers may be motivated by a multitude of reasons, such as profit,
          protest, information gathering, challenge, recreation, or evaluation
          of a system weaknesses to assist in formulating defenses against
          potential hackers. The subculture that has evolved around hackers is
          often referred to as the "computer underground".

        <div id="white-hat">
          <h2>White hat</h2>

          A white hat hacker breaks security for non-malicious reasons, either
          to test their own security system, perform penetration tests or
          vulnerability assessments for a client, or while working for a
          security company that makes security software. The term is generally
          synonymous with ethical hacker, and the EC-Council, among others, have
          developed certifications, courseware, classes, and online training
          covering the diverse arena of ethical hacking.

        <div id="black-hat">
          <h2>Black hat</h2>

          A black hat hacker is a hacker who "violates computer security for
          little reason beyond maliciousness or for personal gain" (Moore,
          2005). The term was coined by Richard Stallman, to contrast the
          maliciousness of a criminal hacker versus the spirit of playfulness
          and exploration in hacker culture, or the ethos of the white hat
          hacker who performs hacking duties to identify places to repair or as
          a means of legitimate employment. Black hat hackers form the
          stereotypical, illegal hacking groups often portrayed in popular
          culture, and are "the epitome of all that the public fears in a
          computer criminal".

        <div id="gray-hat">
          <h2>Grey hat</h2>

          A grey hat hacker lies between a black hat and a white hat hacker,
          hacking for ideological reasons. A grey hat hacker may surf the
          Internet and hack into a computer system for the sole purpose of
          notifying the administrator that their system has a security defect,
          for example. They may then offer to correct the defect for a fee. Grey
          hat hackers sometimes find the defect in a system and publish the
          facts to the world instead of a group of people. Even though grey hat
          hackers may not necessarily perform hacking for their personal gain,
          unauthorized access to a system can be considered illegal and
          unethical.
